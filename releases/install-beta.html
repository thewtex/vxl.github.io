<h1> How to build VXL</h1>

<p>
The most common build system used for VXL is <a
href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>. You should first download and
install CMake. VXL requires CMake version 1.4.3 or higher.
</p>

<p>
Extract the VXL source into the directory <b>vxl-1.0-beta2</b>. Create a
separate output directory <b>bin</b> parallel to the source directory:
<pre>
   .../.../... ---+--- vxl-1.0-beta2 ---+--- vxl
                  |                     |
                  |                     +--- vcl
                  |                     ...
                  |
                  +--- bin
</pre>
Let us call the former $VXLSRC and the latter $VXLBIN.
</p>

<p>
Change current directory to $VXLBIN and run CMake, specifying $VXLSRC
as the source directory.
<dl>
<dt><b>Unix and Cygwin:</b>
  <dd>Run the Curses based front-end
    <pre>
      ccmake $VXLSRC
    </pre>
   or the command line front-end
    <pre>
      cmake -i $VXLSRC
    </pre>
<dt><b>Windows:</b>
  <dd>Run CMakeSetup and specify the source and binary directories as $VXLSRC and $VXLBIN, respectively.
</dl>
Repeatedly select "Configure" ("C" on Unix) until the entries stop
changing and you get the chance to generate the makefiles ("OK" on
Windows, and "G" on Unix).
</p>

<p>
In the CMake interface, you can choose which parts of the VXL tree to
build. The default is to build everything except vgui and its
dependents. Building vgui requires the presence of OpenGL and
GLU. Often, these are in a platform specific area of the machine, and
hence cannot be detected by CMake. If you have these on your system,
and wish to build vgui, set BUILD_VGUI to "ON" and make sure the
appropriate entries in the CMake cache are valid.
