  <h1>VXL Build Frequently Asked Questions&nbsp;
  </h1>

    <li>
      <blockquote><p>I have successfully built VXL under MS Visual Studio, and am now trying to build a simple
    program that uses the libraries. The Linker complains that there are multiple definitions (error
        <code>LNK2005</code>)
    of several things from the C++ Standard Library. What is going wrong?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>These kinds of errors often indicate that you are linking against different C++ run-time libraries that you
      compiled VXL with (release vs debug, static vs DLL stdlib, etc). The flags like
      <code> /MP</code> and <code> /MD</code> much match exactly,
      in VXL's build and your program's build. These flags are set in Visual Studio under
      Settings->C/C++->Code Generation->Use run-time library.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to link against these projects, we've found, is to use CMake for your project too.
      CMake will then make sure the flags match, or else will give you an error or warning.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>I followed the VXL installation documentation, but found that some of the entries in the
        <code>
        CMakeCache.txt</code> file say that CMake could not find programs, paths, etc. Is this a problem?&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>    No. VXL needs very little to build correctly (only a C/C++ compiler at worst), however it can make use of
  various system provided libraries, rather than build its own versions. CMake also looks for lots of system tools
  so that it can understand the environment it is in. So having lots of <code> NOTFOUND</code> entries is quite normal. There is
  no need to worry unless CMake displays a warning or error message while it runs.</p>

    <li>
      <blockquote>
  <p>I used CMake to create a MSVC project with <code>BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY=ON</code>. But when I try to build, it gives message
  &quot;<code>cannot open
  vcl.lib</code>&quot;. What's wrong?&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>    The CMake "Shared Library" feature doesn't work with MSVC. You have to use static libraries. This is mostly
  due to MSVC's requirements to have either a complete list of every exportable identifier or a decoration of every
  identifier in the code. We are too lazy (or appalled at this "feature") to try to fix this. If you absolutely need
  DLLs you can build your code using
  Cygwin, which can produce shared libraries in a "normal" manner. Alternatively, if you only want to export a small
  number of classes or functions, then you can manually list them. See the MSVC tool documentation for further
  details.</li>
